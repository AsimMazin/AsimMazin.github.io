### Overview

<div style="text-align: justify"> We report a machine learning approach using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to analyze multiparametric
MRI for the purpose of differentiating between renal cell carcinoma tumor with (sRCC) and without (nsRCC) sarcomatoid de-differentiation, a transformation that is associated with poorer outcomes. The SOM+LVQ model was trained on mpMRI data from 9 nsRCC and 9 sRCC tumors, validated on a separate cohort of 3 nsRCC and 3 sRCC tumors, and tested on a held-out set of 5 nsRCC and 5 sRCC tumors. An overall classification accuracy of 70% was achieved on the test cohort. </div>
