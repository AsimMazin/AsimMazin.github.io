### Overview
We are interested in enchancing student experience.
One way we can do this is by helping students, who have yet to declare a major, by recommending a list of majors they might be interested in.
We beleive that if we have historical data of student course records and their majors, we should be able to predict potential majors for new students who have yet to declare their majors.
### Objective
Given the historic student records, we would like to create a machine learning model which is able to predict the majors of new students.
