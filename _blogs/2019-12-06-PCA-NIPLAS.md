### Overview
coming soon ..
### Objective
The goal of this project is to implement the NIPALS (non-linear iterative partial least squares) PCA algorithm in Python.
The project will include the following steps:

1- Read the data file, error check and handling of missing values,
2- Convert to a matrix format, remove mean, and scale to unit variance (optional),
3- Calculate the PCA model using NIPALS, calculate relevant statistics, save/export results.
