## Experience {#experince}

Moffit Cancer Center, Tampa, FL
: **Applied Post-Doctoral Fellow**, *Aug 2019 - Present*
- *Apply machine learning on multiparameter MRI dataset*
    - Using self-organized map (SOM) to reduce the dimensionality and create activation map form multiparameter MRI of 24 patients
    - Classify the tumors type from the activation maps using Learning Vector Quantization  (LVQ) with accuracy of 70%

University of South Florida, Tampa, FL
: **Graduate Assistant/Researcher**, at *i*WINLAB, *May 2016 - May 2019*
- *Machine Learning in 5G Wireless Networks (Initial Access)*
    - Addressed the initial access in 5G Millimeter wave bands cellular systems using Recurrent Neural Network (GUR)
    - Learn and predict the userâ€™s distribution from call detail records (CDRs) of Milano city dataset
    - Achieving a high accuracy in prediction the sweeping hopping pattern to send the synchronization signals

- *Anticipatory/proactive mobility management in 5G Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP)
    - Supportive technology for cell-less networks.
    - Achieve High data rates independent of the user location by Enabling Dynamic CoMP
    - Proactively knowing the BSs that will be joining/ leaving the CoMP set as the user moves across the network

- *Physical layer security for 5G/IoT systems*
    - A novel method is proposed to exchange a secret key between two legitimate users using physical layer security methods
    - Achieved high secure communication when the main and eavesdropping channels are uncorrelated

- *Multiple access for IoT networks*
   - Design Slotted Aloha- NOMA (SAN) protocol that provides high throughput
   - Substantial throughput gain of 5.5 dB relative to slotted Aloha

- *Ultra-Low latency in 5G Network*
   - A Bayesian game cell selection / user association approach was proposed to achieve the ultra-low latency (1ms) in 5G Networks
   - Attains the 5G low end-to-end latency target (1ms) with a probability exceeding 80%.

: **Teaching Assistant**, at Electrical Enginiring Department, *Aug 2016 - May 2019*
   - Delivering lectures in Digital Communication & Wireless Networks and architecture courses
   - Preparing exams, grading assignments and exams, and setting up distance learning technology in the classroom

: **Academic Tutor**, INTO USF Tutoring Center, *Aug 2014 - Dec 2018*
   - Tutor Electrical Engineering courses in Wireless & signal Processing area.
   - Lead a policy and procedure committee to revise the vision and mission statements of INTO touring center and mentor new tutors.
