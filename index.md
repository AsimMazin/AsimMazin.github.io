<div style="text-align: justify"> Asim M. Mazin received a B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications engineering in 2007 from the College of
Industrial Technology Misurata, Libya, and an M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in wireless communications from Southern Illinois University in 2013.
His Master's thesis was Peak-to-Average Power Reduction (PAPR) in OFDM using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.
In May 2019, he received his Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Richard D. Gitlin at the University of South Florida with the Innovations in Wireless Information Networking (iWINLAB).
His research interests include Physical Layer Security, multiple access in massive M2M IoT networks, applying machine learning in 5G Wireless Networks. He was previously Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Moffitt Cancer Center, where he developed clinically-relevant diagnostic tools for cancer by using machine learning to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and digitized multiplexed immunohistochemistry (MHIC) image data. Currently, he is with Qualcomm Corporation as a Senior Engineer. </div>
